## Description
The purpose of the this mini project was randomly generate what dinners Rach and I want for each week. It is to save time by not thinking what we want to dinner. Pick and choose. Also choose what how many dinners we want for the week. Usually three or four depending on what our plans are. It takes meals from from HelloFresh that we had from the past. The data is stored in an array.
